# A corpus of computer generated news texts

This is a small corpus of computer generated news texts. The texts were generated using a rule-based automated journalism system built within the [EMBEDDIA research project](http://embeddia.eu/). The Embeddia research project is supported by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program undergrant agreement No 825153, project EMBEDDIA (Cross-Lingual Embeddings for Less-Represented Languages in European News Media). 

The texts are based on data from EuroStat, the statistical agency of the European Union. **We make no quarantees regarding the correctness of the information in the texts.**

The corpus contains texts in two languages, Finnish and English. For both languages, the texts discuss three distinct topics: consumer price indices (`cphi`), healthcare funding (`health_funding`) and healthcare spending (`health_cost`), all discussed on the national level within Europe. Each text has a focus country (as indicated by the filename, e.g. Norway for `full-fi-health_cost-NO.txt`) but can contain information about other countries as well when relevant to the text as per the understanding of the underlying NLG system.
